# Reversing firmware with IDA Pro
*For this procedure IDA __Pro__ is required.*

This document describes a procedure to open a rom dump from a TRÃ…DFRI device
with IDA to analyse its method of operation.

## Opening the file in IDA Pro
The file should be opened in IDA as a regular binary and on the
'Load a new file' dialog the processor type should be set to
'ARM Little-endian[ARM]'. Analyses should be disabled for now as it will
confuse IDA. The Arm base architecture should be set to ARMv7-M.

## Finding the entry point of the binary
The reset vector is the address thats first loaded by the MCU after it has
booted. The reset vector is a 4 byte integer located as second item in the
vector table at location 0x00000004.

Since the MCU is little-endian the value should be read starting at location
0x00000007 and the least-significant bit should be omitted as it is an
indicator for Thumb code.

The least-significant bit of each vector must be 1, indicating that the
exception handler is Thumb code, see
[Thumb state](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.dui0553a/CHDBIBGJ.html#BABDFBBE).

## Analysing the code
The entry point found in the previous step can be used as a starting point for
the auto analyser. At the entry point the 'T' register should be set to 0x01 by
selecting the address and pressing ALT+G.

After this is done the entry point can now be marked as code by pressing C and
analyses can be enabled to analyse the binary.

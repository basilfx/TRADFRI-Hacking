# E2206
INSPELNING smart switch with energy monitoring.

This is very similar to the [E2204](../E2204), but has a few additional parts
populated for energy monitoring.

## Details

* Potted: tiny bit
* Module: unidentified

## Teardown
Remove the screw in the middle (security screw). Then use a pry tool to remove
the front casing, paying attention to the raised border and the tabs on all
four sides

Once inside, remove the two small screw from the main board. One corner is
slightly potted, but it is quite brittle and does not really adhere to the
casing. You can heat up the corner using a heat gun to make it softer.

Then firmly push on the contact pins to remove the board from its housing.
Place the pins on a hard surface, then push the case down. Be aware that the
switch domes must be bent inwards, otherwise they will be damaged.

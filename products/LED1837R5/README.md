# LED1837R5
TRÅDFRI bulb GU10, warm white, 400 lm

This seems to be the successor of the LED1650R5.

## Details

* Socket: GU10
* Potted: no
* Glued: yes (lens cover)
* TRÅDFRI Module: ICC-A-1

## Teardown

Use a hot air gun to soften the glue that holds the lens to the glass body.
Make sure that you heat it up evenly, otherwise the glass will crack. Then use
a small blade to lift up the lens (which has small hooks as well).

You can also heat it up in an oven to heat it up evenly. I tried 150 degrees
Celsius with success.

The LED PCB can be removed by removing the two screws and lifting it up with a
square hook or similar. The heatspreader is glued with white glue (thermal
paste?) to the glass housing. I removed it by re-inserting the screw and then
lifting it with pliers. Do this carefully, or you might cut yourself (been
there, done that).

The PCB is press-fitted into the GU10 pins. To remove the whole PCB, use a side
cutter and carefully clamp perpendicular to the dots on the GU10 pins (don't
try to cut them!). A little pressure makes it then possible to lift the PCB
from the GU10 pins.

Details:

* Socket: E27
* Potted: likely

### LED1624G9

Details:

* Potted: likely

### LED1536G5

Details:

* Socket: E14
* Potted: likely

### LED1537R6

Details:

* Socket: GU10
* Potted: yes

Teardown:

* The potting material can be easily removed. It does not stick and will crumble in smaller peaces once you remove it.

Bulb pinout:

* 1: Common (+ max 28.4V @ 100%)
* 2: Warm leds (-)
* 3: Cold leds (-)

### LED1650R5

Details:

* Socket: GU10
* Potted: no

Teardown:

* Use a small flat screw driver to lift up the plastic lens.

TRÅDFRI Module pinout:

* PA1 -> unused (but soldered)
* PB13 -> LED driver

Power usage:

| Brightness | Power (W) | Cos φ |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| 100%       | 6.0       | 0.80  |
| 50%        | 1.6       | 0.62  |
| 10%        | 0.7       | 0.40  |
| Off        | 0.0       | 1.00  |

Measured using a Voltcraft 3000 energy monitor.

### LED1837R5
This seems to be the successor of the LED1650R5.

Details:

* Socket: GU10
* Potted: no
* Glued: yes (lens cover)

Teardown:

* Use a hot air gun to soften the glue that holds the lens to the glass body. Make sure that you heat it up evenly, otherwise the glass will crack. Then use a small blade to lift up the lens.

TRÅDFRI Module pinout:

* PB13 -> LED driver

### E1525 (Motion Sensor)

Details:

* Battery: 2x CR2032

TRÅDFRI Module (unverified):

* Time selection dial (R13): PA1 (Looks like a potentiometer between R12 high side and a FET to GND enabled directly by PB14.)
* Day/night selection dial (R15): PB15 (Dito, with resistor R14 and same transistor.)
* Pairing button (S1): Silicone rubber button puling PA0 directly to GND

* The motion detection dome is connected (one pin directly, one indirectly) to an "E93196C 5090C 9A" labelled 8-pin chip to which also PC10 and PB14 are connected (needs further investigation).

* Various test points:
  * VCC: `TP8_1`, `TP8_2`
  * GND: `TP2_1`, `TP3_2`
  * PB13: `TP2_2`
  * PA0: `TP4_1`, `TP4_2`
  * PA1: `TP5_2`

The module is easy to take apart, and debug wires can be soldered on without separating the radio / MCU PCB from the carrier PCB. The carrier board is labelled "D-Sensor-A1-01-A-V2.0".

### E1745 (Motion Sensor)

Details:

* Battery: 2x CR2032

TRÅDFRI Module (unverified):

* Time selection button: Connected to tK3
* Day/Night selection button: Connected to tK1
* Pairing button: Connected to tK2

* The motion detection dome is connected (one pin directly, one indirectly) to an "E93196B 0940A 60A" labelled 8-pin chip.

* Various test points:
  * VCC: `VDD`
  * GND: `GND`
  * Pairing BTN: `tK2`
  * Day/Night BTN: `tK1`
  * Time Select BTN: `tK3`
  * ???: `AL`
  * ???: `ENT`
  * ???: `TX1`

Module is easy to take apart with the right tools, debug wires could be soldered on without separating the radio from the carrier PCB. The carrier board is labelled "D-SS-X2-01-A-V2.1" and the date printed is 2018-06-05. Tradfri module markings visible are Draco1.0_105° and 0255C.

### ICPSLC24-10NA (LED output controller/dimmer)

Details:

* Potted: no

The output appears to be measured by the module somehow.
Detailed PCB investigation required.

TRÅDFRI Module pinout (incomplete/unverified):

* PA0: K1 (Reset key)
* PA1: Goes to ZD1, through R9 and then to OUT+, possibly output measuring?
* PB13: Pulls down the FET Gate
* PF0: Pin 2 on header
* PF1: Pin 3 on header

### ICPSHC24-10EU-IL-1 (10W LED driver/dimmer)

10 Watt Power supply with the 24 V output being controlled by ICPSLC24-10NA

### ICPSHC24-30EU-IL-1 (30W LED driver/dimmer)

30 Watt Power supply with the 24 V output being controlled by ICPSLC24-10NA

### L1529 (FLOALT 60x60)

Details:

* Potted: no

TRÅDFRI Module pinout (incomplete):

* PA0: Pulse (not very readable)
